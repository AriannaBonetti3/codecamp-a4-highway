# Collaboration Guidelines

## Homework Strategy
Our team will approach the homework by dividing tasks among members based on expertise and workload. Each member will be responsible for specific sections and making sure that everybody understands. However, it is decided to try and work together when it's possible. This to make sure that everybody understands and is able to follow the workflow.

## Branching Strategy
- We will use a **main** branch as the stable version of our project.
- Each team member will create feature branches off **main** for their assigned tasks, if needed, otherwise, only one branch will be created and we will work together on that.
- Branch names will follow this format: `feature/task-name` (e.g., `feature/database-setup`).

## Code Review Process
- Every pull request (PR) must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
- Reviews will focus on code quality, functionality, and adherence to agreed-upon guidelines.
- Constructive feedback will be given through PR comments.

## Meeting Plan
- Meetings will be held Tuesday morning in campus.
- A standing meeting schedule will be set to align with deadlines.
- Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.

## Workflow Checklist
1. **Pull** the latest changes from `main` before starting work.
2. Create a new branch based on the assigned task if needed.
3. Commit changes with clear messages.
4. Push the branch and open a pull request.
5. Request a review from at least one team member.
6. Address any feedback and merge the PR into `main`.
7. **Pull** the latest changes again to stay updated.
