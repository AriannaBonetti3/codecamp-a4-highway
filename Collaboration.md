# Collaboration Guidelines

## Homework Strategy
Our team will approach the homework together to make sure that everybody is on the same page and understands the process.Therefore, it is decided to try and work together when it's possible.

## Branching Strategy
- We will use a **main** branch as the stable version of our project.
- Each team member will create feature branches off **main** for their assigned tasks, if needed.

## Code Review Process
- Every pull request (PR) must be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
- Reviews will focus on code quality, functionality, and adherence to agreed-upon guidelines.
- Constructive feedback will be given through PR comments.

## Meeting Plan
- Meetings will be held Tuesday morning on campus.
- A standing meeting schedule will be set to align with deadlines.
- Additional meetings will be scheduled as needed.
